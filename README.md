# PhysocHack-2024
The second edition of Physoc's yearly Hackathon with an Astro theme.
The 2023 challenge has 2 phases:
    * Phase 1: **The black hole basics**
    Jupyter Notebook (made by the amazing Dr. Carolin Villforth - with some slight changes regarding the updated data sets and certain code lines). The submission of this notebook is mandatory for arriving in phase 1. The time alloted for coding should be sufficient for the submission of this complete notebook, therefore the completition of the notebook will be used as the requirement for the participation award.
    * Phase 2: **Extensions:** Show us what you can do!
    3 extensions are proposed for this section, but you are welcome to amaze us with other extensions.
    Phase 2 is designed for more advanced students. It is a space for you to explore black hole data and mechanics further, and showcase your skills to the judges.
